				<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Alexander Mirtsopoulos.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm an Australian born Greek who is studying the Bachelor of Information Technology course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.</p>
			<p>I am always looking forward to studying and expanding my knowledge, being always ready to learn more.</p>
      <p>I took an interest in Information Technology at a young age, when my dad had firsted introduced me to a computer and the concept of Videogames.</p>
      <p>What had caught my attention more than the actual Videogames themselves, was the thought of how they were created.</p>
      <p>For this reason, i'm a really big fan of all things technical, but mostly of online multiplayer Videogames. </p>
      <p>A Videogame I grew up on and fell in-love with over the years was League of Legends, </p>
      <p>and it has always been a dream of mine to play for a professional team and be compeating at the highest of leagues against other professionals.</p>
      <p>I chose to study at RMIT due to its accessability and how open the campus is. During my studies at RMIT, </p>
      <p>I expect to learn how to properly engage myself and have enough preperation to branch out and search for a job which I will love.</p>

				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>My formal education has been through RMIT in the IT field. Having moved around particular areas of IT in the workforce ranging from - Web Design and Development, IT Solutions, Search Engine Optimisation, etc.</p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>My highest achievment as of right now is highschool graduation.</br>
					During highschool, I attempted to learn as much as I could about computers from my information technology teacher, </p>
          <p> constantly looking upto him as he was my main source of knowledge. Most of what I know about computerised technology comes from him and I can't thank him enough.</p>
				</section>
        <div id="main">
        <!-- Image -->
          <img class="myPhoto" src="img/Person1.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;">
          <p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">Test-1</a></p>
          <img class="myPhoto" src="img/Person2.jpg"style="width:375px;height:550px;">
          <p><a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/workplace-personality-quiz-0817">Test-2</a></p>
          <img class="myPhoto" src="img/Person3.jpg"style="width:450px;height:225px;">
          <p><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Test-3</a></p>
          <p>For me, these results show that I don't plan to put myself, or other coworkers above one another and instead see as all as equals in the workplace, </p>
          <p>especially if on the same team and working towards the same goal.</p>
          <p>This should be accounted for when forming a team by seeing who in similar branches and divisions tend to work well with their peers through workplace testing and quizes.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>Most of my hobbies are computer related, i grew up around technology and playing games and it really sparked my interests towards how they work, making me want to learn more and more every day.</p>
					<p>A lot of my acquaintances are also very fascinated by computerised technology, and occasionally we spend time sharing things we have learnt to help broaden our knowledge.</p>

			<header class="sectionHeading">
				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My ideal job is something that can keep me focussed and pressure me to push myself passed my limits.</p>
			<p>I've always wanted to be a professional League of Legends player purely because of the bond which the professional players share with their teammates.</p>
      <p>Watching as they treat each-other as family when they celebrate every win, or try to recover from every loss, they always do it as a family.</p>
      <p>The position I would like for myself would to be the midlaner of a professional team, as it is the role in which I feel most comfortable in.</p>
      <p>The main skills and qualifications needed for this dream to become a reality, includes to not only stand out from the crowd of millions of players, </p>
      <p>but be able to show the determination and endurance required.</p>
      <h2>My Workplace Personality</h2>
      <p>According to online testings, these are my workplace personalities, along with the links to each individual test.</p>
