          <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My Project Idea which would help not only myself, but anyone with a similar career plan is a phone application </p>
        <p>which would search for and find opponents of a similar skill ranking
        to compete against to help both the users to improve.</p>
        <p>Regular match-making will pair you with teammates and opponents with a poor system making it extremely one sided for one of the teams, whereas this application</p>
        <p>will let you decide whether you would like to do team versus team or a single player versus player, to make it so you can choose to either improve your
        own independance skills, or your ability to work together as a team.</p>
<!-- pussy lips -->
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>My motivation to make this application was that regular match-making doesn't seem as effective and or as efficient as I feel like it could be.</p>
        <p>Personally, I feel as if my application idea for my custom match making for personal improvement will not only help me, but help better a lot of users.</p>
        <p>A main issue with the regular match-making which League of Legends provides, is that there's no control over it and that leads to a mix of really </p>
        <p>good and outstanding players being matched up with a few people who still have some things to work on, leading the better players to act aggressive </p>
        <p>and hostile towards their under-performing teammates. With my applications ability to draft players, I feel as if this would solve a big ammount of these issues from occuring.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Upon installing and creating an account on my Application, aswell as linking your account to the application allowing you to show your full profile to poentional teammates and or opponents,</p>
        <p>the users would then have the ability to search through other players and be able to scout for teammates, opponents or even new friends to simply chat with.</p>
        <p>Through the application, the users will have access to drafting teams against opposing teams and through the chatting system, will be able to pick a time which they would like to</p>
        <p>work together, or verse eachother as a way for both of the players to improve. The application will also include a reporting feature to report abusive and unfair players.</p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>The skills required to create my application would be high-end coding to avoid bugs and people who want to abuse the match-making by faking accounts.</p>
        <p>The software and hardware shouldn't be too hard to aquire as a mediocre computer should be able to do the trick, though to find the skills may prove of some difficulty.</p>
        <p>As a professional coder could be hired, if someone were to code their application by themselves without the advanced skills, they may struggle to avoid running into errors and it may take a decent amount of time to complete.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>If my project is successful, as it is expected to be, any player using the application are assumed to be improving at a faster rate as they would if they were just regularly playing the game.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but with the better match-making system, the toxicity (toxicity refers to harrasment and abuse) of players is assumed to decrease to a lower level of which it is regularly at during normal match-making.</p>
